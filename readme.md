# Jade and Stylus in 15 minutes
## a.k.a. How to create Harinder's G-Spot

It's all in the `src` folder. Feel free to fork me uhh... Harinder's g-spot err... this repo. 

You'll need the following `npm` packages:

    npm install jade
    npm install stylus
    npm install nib

To compile, install `coffeescript`
    
    npm install coffee-script -g
    cake watch
    
All files in `src` folder compiles into the root folder. Feel free to create your own mini-site with Jade and Stylus!
